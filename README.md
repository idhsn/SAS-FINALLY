## üìå About  
SAS-FINALLY is a text analysis tool written in C. This was my **final SAS project**, which helped me get accepted into **YouCode**. SAS is a trial period to evaluate students‚Äô skills, and this project demonstrated my ability to handle complex C programming tasks.  

It includes **text analysis, dictionary management, word search, sorting, and statistics**, all accessible through a **user-friendly interactive menu**.

## ‚ú® Features  
- üìù **Text Analysis**: Analyze and manipulate text.  
- üìö **Dictionary Management**: Show unique words with counts and positions.  
- üîç **Word Search**: Find exact words and words containing substrings.  
- üîÑ **Sorting**: Sort dictionary alphabetically, by frequency, or length.  
- üìä **Statistics**: Global text statistics and word cloud.  
- üåü **Interactive Menu**: Easy-to-use menu navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Libraries:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `mery.h`  
- **System Requirements:** Borland C compiler (recommended), terminal/console  
- **Header File (.h):** The project uses a custom header (`mery.h`). Make sure to include it in your editor/IDE so the compiler can find it.

## üì¶ Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- **Borland C** (or compatible C IDE)  
- Windows terminal or console  

### Quick Start  

    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SAS-FINALLY.git
    cd SAS-FINALLY

    # Open main.c in Borland C
    # Ensure mery.h is included in your project

    # Compile and run within Borland C IDE
    # Use Run > Compile and Run

### Notes  
- Include `mery.h` in your project, otherwise compilation will fail.  
- Keep file paths simple to avoid errors.  
- This project is optimized for **Borland C**.
